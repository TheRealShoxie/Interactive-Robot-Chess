Saturday:
    - Had to fresh install linux distro
    - Reconfiguring all needed files
    - Started adding the ros kortex github repository to the package
    - spawned the gen3 robot model
    - Started trying to add camera to the model
        - https://deebuls.github.io/devblog/robotics/2022/01/19/Add-Realsense-Camera-Kinova-Gen3-Gazebo.html
        - Using this for gazebo plugin: https://github.com/pal-robotics/realsense_gazebo_plugin
        - used this tutorial to get it to work in gazebo: https://github.com/pal-robotics/realsense_gazebo_plugin/issues/7
    - Scratched the intelrealsense due to move_it problems because it has its own collision
        - so I added a depth and normal camera using this:

    - Started looking into adding a chessboard into the world
        - Took chessboard models from: https://gitioc.upc.edu/rostutorials/gazebo_sensors_tutorial/-/tree/ab3ed9f585e19d5899b1a1fd356a4746b57ff68f/models
