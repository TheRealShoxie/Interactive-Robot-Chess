Tuesday:
    - No meeting as we are in easter break.
    - Finished initial intercommunication between chess wrapper and ircServer in ROS system.
    - Decided to continue sprint 2 as it is not finished yet.
    - Started working on UI implementation for chess
        - Started creating a homepage with a menu break
        - Started working on Chess engine start option
            - Added a function to create showChoiceDialog.
            - Renamed AlertMessages to PopUpMessages as that class will also hold the ChoiceDialog popups.
            - Now choosing of which chessengine to use works and it will close any previous chess engine processes automatically.
    Review:
        - For tomorrow start implementing chess game on UI. Ignore setting search and engineOptions for now.
        - Flexibility with commands helping out a lot. Need to find a way to get around the while loops so I am not stuck in there forever. 
        - Need to check if there is a possibility for that to happen?

Wednesday:
    - Started working on GUI Chess Board. Decided to use 3rd party code as this is not the goal of the project. Used is: https://github.com/Stevoisiak/JavaFX-Online-Chess
        - It has MIT license. Pictures different license so need to be careful.
        - Did this because makes workflow faster.
        - Able to display

    - Review:
        - Switching between black and white side doesnt work
        - Promotion doesnt work yet
        - Castling doesnt work yet
        - Still no move command send to server and getting computer move back
        - These need to be worked on tomorrow
        - Further comments need to be made.
        - Further License reference needs to be made.


Thursday:
    - Started working on reviewed problems from yesterday
    - Scrabed legal or illegal moves on the UI side and move it to the ros system
        - Reasons being that if played in person the ROS system needs to deal with checking for legal or illegal moves not the UI
        - We will have some 
    - Implented basic chessboard and legal illegal move checker 
    - Need to work on more tomorrow on legal or illegal on ros system tomorrow and create tests

Sunday:
    - Wrote some tests for CHessBoard including from FenString to Board
    - Valid/Invalid moves
    - Making a move and then checking the updated BoardState
    - Something not completely working with halfMoves and wholeMoves. Need to double check the logic again!
    - Most of the logic has been done including castling. Check and Checkmate needs to be implemented and put on hold for now.
    - Problem with ChessEngine consistency of the UCI handler. Seems like they are empty ?
    - Needs to be discussed in meeting tomorrow why
