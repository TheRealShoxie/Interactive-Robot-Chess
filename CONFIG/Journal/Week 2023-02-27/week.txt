Monday:
    - Integrated User Stories into github
    - Created Product Backlog Board within project
    - Created Sprint Backlog 1
        - Using user stories #1,#2 and #3 as they should be a good foundation start for the project
        - Creating my tasks and spikes for each of the stories.

Tuesday:
    - Creating Journal within GitHub and changing away from formal meeting notes
        - too much work to do it formally easier to just write it down informally
    - Starting on research which language to use UI
        - Looking at Java vs kotlin
            - I am more comfortable with Java compared to kotlin
            - Java libraries can be used for android and because it runs in a JVM
              it can be multi-platform(https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/multiple-platform). 
        - Looking at Java vs Python
            - Was thinking if I want to do python, but I would rather work in Java
              as I have more understanding on how to create the UI using javaFX(https://openjfx.io/)
              and using JUnit(https://junit.org/junit5/). Whereas with Python I do not know how to do
              testing or how to create a user interface. This could be done with some research but as I 
              see no actual upside to using Java based on my understanding of the project so far(https://www.guru99.com/java-vs-python.html).
              Java has more of an Object orientated approach which I prefer and thus will be choosing Java.
              Based on that article java is used on more platforms. My UI should not be really intensive on algorithm thus the slower run time
              due to JIT compiler shouldn't be a big problem.
    - Starting Research for Folder Hierarchy Development 
        - Decided to split into UI and ROS and will be further split into its library and packages if needed.
    - Some research into branching
        - https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/managing-branches
        - Will be creating a branch per Sprint, maybe create sub branches for each user story or task unsure.
        - Created "sprint1 branch". This will be where all the code will be written before it will be merged into main branch.
