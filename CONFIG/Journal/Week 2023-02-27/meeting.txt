Meeting:
    - Talk about why Scrum
    - Change Format
        - Merge Chapter 3 and 4, so that we have definition and my implementation
        - Remove Chapter 2 as it makes no sense to have this here.
        - For referencing agile manifest write along lines of:
            - ..following 3 features from Agile Manifesto[Reference number]
        - Referencing paragraphs or certain sections in bigger documents use [#referenceNumber, "Title"] in latex \cite{reference}["Section or paragraph"]
        - delegated instead of deligated for Scrum master in implementation
    - remove pdf from repository as it completely overwrites the pdf and hard to follow changes
    - revision from newest to oldest in that order
    - good idea on architecture draft.
    - good starting point on user stories
    - testing can be done after I have written code too
    - No big documents need to be created
    - Mentioned I would like to use Java for UI
    - Mentioned I will use C++ for ROS and will need to learn it from scratch
    - Referencing code from official document should be done even if it might not be needed.(Better reference than not even if it is basics that are normal understanding)
    - Normally you reference import stuff only but as mentioned at the point above it might be a good idea to do it anyway.
