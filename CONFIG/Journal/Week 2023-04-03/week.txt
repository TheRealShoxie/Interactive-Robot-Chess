Monday:
    - Meeting with Maxim
    - Helped me create deconstructors and a shared pointer
    - Adding promotion still needs to be tested
    - Need to add check and check mate
    - Need to implement castling promotion and check/check mate on ui

Tuesday:
    - Started writing tests for promotion
    - Realized that I have a problem with pieces overlapping 
    - Need to implement that I am not in checkmate if I can block or take a piece and that then gets me out of checkmate
    - If pawn gets promoted I dont do king or checkmate checking
