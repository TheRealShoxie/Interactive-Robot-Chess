Monday:
    - Mid-demo
    - Weekly meeting
    - Working initial chess engine:
        - Using https://gist.github.com/konstantint/d49ab683b978b3d74172 for piping to the chess engines. MIT license used.
        - Creating a SubProcessHandler that includes above mentioned code. Then creating UCI handle to deal with all the talking of the Chess Engine.
        - Creating the ChessWrapper class which deals with all the necessary commands and so on
        - Fen string explanation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation

Tuesday:
    - Started working on an UCIHandler.
    - Which deals with the logic of sending movement command

Wednesday:
    - Finished creating first stage of all UCIHandler commands
    - tested option extracted which works
    - testing fen string (seems to work for now)
    - started working on ChessEngine.cpp implementation
    - Main implementation of ChessEngine.cpp is finished.
    - Algorithms and logic still need to be tested which will be done tomorrow

Thursday:
    - Time constraint wise testing for logic will be on hold for now.
    - Creating a way to use different chess engines
    - 2nd chess engine used is Komodo https://komodochess.com/
    - non commercial open source

Friday:
    -took a break.

Saturday:
    - Started working intercommunication between ChessEngineWrapperNode and ServerNode
    - Initial methods for talking setup.
    - Create logic in chesswrapper engine still and add code for moving pieces then start working on User Interface implementation.

Sunday:
    - Nothing has been done a break was taken.
