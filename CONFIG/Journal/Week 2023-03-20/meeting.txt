Monday:
    - Talked about the demo and that it went well
    - got explained piping in linux. 
    - Talked about how I am using 3rd party code with MIT license to deal with the talking to the chess engine.
    - Discussed how sprint1 went:
        - Took longer than expected because a lot had to be learned. 
        - No Unit Testing done yet but otherwise went well. Unit testing and testing will be written later on to focus on getting functionality.
        - Do testing on more complex stuff though!
    - Discussed what will be done in sprint2:
        - Chess engine and wrapper implementation on ros side and user interface side
        - Should be done within a week
