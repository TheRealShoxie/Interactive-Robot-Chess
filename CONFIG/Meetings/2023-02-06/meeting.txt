Meeting: Weekly Project Meeting
People present: Omar Ibrahim and Maxim Buzdalov
Circulation list: All project members
Author: Omar Ibrahim
Version: 1.1


Matters arising:
=============
1. General


2. Project Outline
A review of the project outline draft was held and following feedback was given:

Project deliverables:
  - a deliverable for experiments/protocols/testing
  - using double dash -- instead of single one after deliverable name

Project description:
  - summarize user interface; merge paragraph 3 and 4. Maybe get rid of a few sentences
  - Merge safety and robotics; split if necessary
  - First paragraph contains what the project is and what it is not about.
    Including not using a self built chess engine.

Project Tasks:
  - Check for typos

References:
  - add OpenCV References

Writing Style:
  - No support for what I mention. Work on structure for content and make it more compactly packed.
  - General writing style info:
      - Try to remove repeating content.
      - When writing be conscious of the audience you want to research
      - In big documents, remind of terms instead of referring back to them,
        especially if a section purely talks about a certain term


3. Chess engine
Initial research done into chess engine. Different types of notations. There is a universal chess interface (UCI),
which might be useful to make the chess engine plug and play. Instead of using notation to save board state internally,
use a 2d array. Look into a implementation for the chess engines.

4. Chess pieces
Instead of initially calibrating them, a general approach might be better.


New business:
=============
1. Tasks this week which are new 
  - Setting up ROS manipulator environment
  - Set up development cycle

Actions:
=============
1. Finish Project Outline Draft and change it into release
2. Create a software development cycle
3. Setup ROS manipulator environment with its dependencies and packages.
4. Prototype chess engine implementation
