Background and Objectives:

	Abstract:
		- Talk about the overall short version of the whole document
			- Talk about what the project is
				- The name of it 
				- What it does
				- Languages used
			- Development process used
			- Key findings and 
			- Major issues encountered
			- Where we are at
	
	Background:
	
		- Talk about the objective of my project, use project outline for this
			- Robot arm that plays chess against a human player
				- Write about the aim of it
				
			- Talk about the example I looked into
				- https://sir.upc.edu/projects/rostutorials/final_work/index.html
				
			- Talk about the 2 different robot that were available
				- URE5e and Kinova gen3
				
			- Talk about UCI and Chess Engines
			- Talk about my motivation and interest in this project
			- 
				
			
				
				
	
	Analysis:
	
		- Introduce the points that will be talked about
		
		- How I would create the archtecture
			- Possibly show early draft of the architecture
		
		- Interface
			- Talk about how the interface is made
			- Why are we doing networking instead of hardcoded onto the server
			- Talk about Language modularity
			- Language Modularity in regards to UI
		
		- Robot movement
			- Talk about ROS and why C++
			- Talk about the decision to choose the kinova robot
		
		- Chess engine
			- Why did I go with the route of UCI
			- Talk about plug and play system and why
		
		- Cameras
			- Computer vision
			- Talk about OpenCV
		
		- Analysis of ROS and the language to use
	
	
	
	Process:
		- Talk about my development process used refer to the development specification
		
		
Requirements:
	- Talk about the requirements for the project
		- Talk about the User stories created
		- List them
		
	- Describe them a bit in detail
	- Possible a sequence diagram of how an interaction should work
	

Desing:
	- Architecture
		- Talk about the overall archtitecture and changes that were made
		- Such as moving to an internal protcol and not using the external for internal too
		- Overall protocolling system wide(Talk about networking)
		- Sequence diagram to show flow of program
		- System state how it works
		- 

		
	- More detailed design
		- ROS internal communication
			- Using state machines in certain places
			- Why a system state is used
			- Why the different nodes
			
		- Chess Engine interfacing
		- Talk about singular nodes
			- Image processing
				- Show finished product
				- goodfeatures vs contour moments
			- Robot arm 
				- Modelling
				- movement how it works
			- Server node
			- SystemStateMachine

		- Talk about JAVA library
			- how it works and interconnects to overall and such
		- Talk about Java UI
			- Why and what it is 
				- Being just a showcase not a finished product
			- Inspiration taken 


Implementation:
	- Early implementation of server
		- Communication problems
	- Early implementation of chess engine
		- Unfamiliar with language
		- Piping
		- UCI implementation
		- Extracting information
		
		
	- Talk about early systems took way too long to implement
		- Due to inexperience possibly not enough research
		- and so on
		
	- Talk about tearing apart the direct connection between chesswrapper and server node
		- Not that big of a problem but created a revamping of internal communication which forced the
			creation of the internal protocol
			
	- Talk about needing to create a way to switch into full simulation and no simulation because it would be 
		wasteful not to just be able to play chess against it
		
	- Design Issue with nettworking as in Java not having a timeout and ROS being stuck when communicating or executing internal commands
	
	- Robot arm movement how kortex works and how robot description
	
	- Modelling
	
		
	- Finish up by concluding and reviewing the implementation against the planned requirements
	
	
	
Testing:
	- Talk about Unit tests done and overall testing approach
	- Include it and the manual tests
	

Evaluation of myself:
	- Talk about my evaluation
