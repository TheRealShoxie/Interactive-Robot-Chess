# Background & Objectives

## Introduction
This Chapter introduces the project, mentions the motivation for choosing this topic and discusses all relevant initial investigation.

## Project
The Interactive Robot Chess project short IRC is a robotic system that enables users to play chess against a robotic arm in a physical or simulated environment. 

## Background
The motivation for choosing this topic was based around an interest in developing robotic systems that interact with human environments. Engaging in a game of chess against a robotic arm presents this opportunity. As the overa
