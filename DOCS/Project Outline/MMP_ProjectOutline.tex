\section{Project description}
%==============================================================================
The Interactive Robot Chess project will develop a robotic and desktop based application, to enable users to 
play chess with a robotic arm.\newline

\noindent This project will develop a desktop application to allow users and developers to interact and obtain 
information from the robotic system. There will be a desktop-based interface, developed in Kotlin\cite{kotlin}, for users 
and developers. This should have two different layouts, one for users and the other for developers. To determine   
which interface will be accessed an authentification process will be used.\newline

\noindent The user interface should show the current board state to allow users to correct the system if the board 
state varies from the physical board state. Further it should allow the user to choose a bot the user should be able 
to choose from a variety of difficulties. Moreover the user interface should include a visual and textual guide on 
how to setup the environment(callibration process) of the system to play a game of chess.\newline

\noindent The developer interface should have the same functionality as the user interface. It should further expand 
on that interface by adding access to backend information and the ability to change values or states of the robotic 
application.\newline

\noindent The robotic application adds functionality to the robot arm and the overall system. This system will be 
developed in the ROS middleware environment\cite{ros}. The robotic application will consist of a physical robot arm for chess
movements, object detection and safety features; a simulation environment to test the functionality and safety of the 
system; a chess engine to enable the user to play a bot; an overhead camera to see the physical board state and safety 
features; and a communication protocol to enable communication to the desktop application.\newline 

\noindent The safety features of the overall system will need to take into account physical objects, eg. user arm,
to insure neither the robotic arm nor the user will be hurt or damaged. To accomplish this the overhead camera and 
the robot arm sensors and camera will be used to enforce a stop of the robot arm.\newline

\noindent This system can be used as a ground system to expand it to not only play chess, but also playing other 
kinds of board games. Further introducing the option to let other users, through an internet connection, do the 
movements instead of an engine will make it possible to interact and fill up empty players by actual users.\newline

%==============================================================================
\section{Proposed tasks}
%==============================================================================
The following tasks will be performed on this project:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Investigation of the robotic arm and build process.} This task will explore the options
                  of robotic arms and how to implement them in the ROS middleware. Further it will be necessary 
                  to consider the connection to external devices for communication. Reasearch into how to move 
                  chess pieces will be looked into.\newline
                  There will be a meeting with the Robotic group of the Computer Science department to 
                  determine which robotic arm will be used for this project based on its availablity and the 
                  investigation done.\newpage

    \item \textbf{Investigation of the chess engine and safety measures.} After confirming the robotic arm there 
                  will be a need to investigate which chess engine to use, an example for such a chess engine would 
                  be stockfish \cite{stockfish}. This investigation also includes the need to discover the method of interacting with 
                  the chess engines.\newline
                  The safety measures will need to be determined based on law and above mentioned safety features. 
                  Further there is a need to research how to implement these safety measures based on the available 
                  equipment.

    \item \textbf{Investagion of object detecion.} Here research to detect objects using cameras, such as 
                  the chess pieces, chess board and the users arm, will be accomplished. The detection will be 
                  realized by using libraries such as OpenCV.
                  
    \item \textbf{Development.} The development will consist of two main subtasks:
          \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Robotic application.} The first part of the development will form the foundation of the 
                         project. It will construct the underlying data for the board. Arm movements to pick up and 
                         place chess pieces and getting to a resting position will be produced. This will also 
                         include the callibration and detection of above mentioned objects, to interact and gain 
                         information. Further the communication module and its corresponding protocol will generate 
                         the possibility to make internal information available to external devices. Safety measures 
                         are going to be implemented in the movement of the arm.
                         
            \item  \textbf{Desktop application.} The second part of the development will introduce the interface for 
                          the user and the developer. The interface is written in Kotlin to make it available to 
                          different desktop environments. It will include all above mentioned functionality. 
                          Further the communication to the robotic arm will be realized utilizing the communication 
                          protocol.
          \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Project Meetings and Project Workflow.} The project will involve weekly supervisor meetings. A 
                  project workflow will be setup up to ease the process of project management and realization of 
                  needed tasks. This will asisst in the reports at the meetings and the writing of the project 
                  report.

    \item \textbf{Preparation for demonstrations.} There is a need to prepare for the Mid-Project and End-Project 
                  demonstration, using notes and creating a presentation.
                  
\end{itemize}
